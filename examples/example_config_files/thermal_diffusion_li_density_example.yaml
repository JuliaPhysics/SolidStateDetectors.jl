# Example configuration file for ThermalDiffusionLithiumDensity
# This demonstrates the default hardcoded values that were previously embedded in the source code
# Reference: src/ImpurityDensities/ThermalDiffusionLithiumDensity.jl

name: Example Lithium Diffusion Profile

impurity_density:
  model: li_diffusion
  lithium_annealing_temperature: 623  # Kelvin - default annealing temperature when lithium is diffused
  lithium_annealing_time: 18  # minutes - default annealing time
  doped_contact_id: 1  # ID of the contact with lithium doping
  # Optional parameters (if not specified, they will be calculated):
  # lithium_density_on_contact: calculated as saturated density at given temperature
  # lithium_diffusivity_in_germanium: calculated based on annealing temperature
