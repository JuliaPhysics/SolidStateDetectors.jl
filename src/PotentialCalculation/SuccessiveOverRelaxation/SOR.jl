This function handles the grid points with volumes which are not fully depleted.
The decision depends on the new calculated potential value, `new_potential`, 
for the respective grid point in that iteration and 
the potential values of the neighboring grid points, `neighbor_potentials`.

If `vmin = minimum(neighbor_potentials) < new_potential < vmax = maximum(neighbor_potentials)` => fully depleted

Else => (partially) undepleted => Set `new_potential` to the respective extremum `vext`, either `vmin` or `vmax`.
Depending on how much the potential overshooted `abs(new_potential - vext)`,
the impurity density in the grid point is scaled down via reducing `imp_scale âˆˆ [0, 1]` of this grid point.

This decision is based on the fact that the potential inside a solid-state 
detector increases monotonically from a `p+`-contact towards an `n+`-contact.
Thus, there cannot be local extrema. 

!!! note
    If a fixed charge impurity is present, e.g. due to a charged passivated surface,
    this handling is probably not valid anymore as the potential between a 
    `p+`-contact towards an `n+`-contact is not required to change monotonically anymore.
